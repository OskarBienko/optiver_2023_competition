Weighted Average Price***\n\n\n- **Weighted Averaged Price (WAP)**\n\nWAP in a nut shell, it's a price take bid/ask size into consideration. A fair book-based valuation must take two factors into account: the level and the size of orders.\n\n$$ WAP = \\frac{BidPrice_{1} * AskSize_{1} + AskPrice_{1} * BidSize_{1}}{BidSize_{1}+AskSize_{1} } $$\n\nAs you can see, if two books have both bid and ask offers on the same price level respectively, the one with more offers in place will generate a lower stock valuation, as there are more intended seller in the book. On the other hand, more seller implies a fact of more supply on the market resulting in a lower stock valuation.\n\nThe idea behind this weighting is that higher buying pressure tends to drive prices up, while an increase in sellers tends to push prices down.\nTo illustrate this idea with an extreme example: consider a specific moment where the best bid is 5 with a BidSize of 5000, and the best ask is 6 with an AskSize of 10. In this scenario, the number of buyers is way larger than the number of sellers, suggesting that the price should be very close to 6. The WAP reflects this intuition, as it gives more weight to the ask price.\n\n- **Let's take a look at the following 2 scenarios:**\n\n- **Scenario 1: More Buyer, more bid szie, therefore higher WAP**\n\n        - bid price = 1, ask price =2, with ask size = 1, bid size = 2\n\n$$WAP_{1} = \\frac{1 * 1 + 2 * 2}{3}  = \\frac{5}{3}$$\n\n- **Scenario 2: More Seller, more ask size,  therefore lower WAP**\n\n        - bid price = 1, ask price =2, with ask size = 2, bid size = 1\n\n\n$$ WAP_{2} = \\frac{1 * 2 + 2 * 1}{3}  = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\n\nRemark: Note that in most of cases, during the continuous trading hours, an order book should not have the scenario when bid order is higher than the offer, or ask, order. In another word, most likely, the bid and ask should never be in cross.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-14T11:48:26.297047Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-14T11:48:26.297427Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-14T11:48:26.308678Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-14T11:48:26.297402Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-14T11:48:26.307198Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# ***Target Variable***\n\n- **What is Target**: \n\n    The 60 second future move in the wap of the stock, less the 60 second future move of the synthetic index.

There are many different kinds of auction, for example London Stock Exchange offers **Opening Auction**, **Intra-Day Auction**, and **Closing Auction**. In this competition teams are particularly interested in the type of a **closing auction**.\n    \n    - 2) Closing auction starts after continuous trading (Market Open session)\n    \n         - Take London Stock Exchange for example: \n   \n            (2-1) Opening Auction Session: 7:50 pm - 8:00 pm  \n            (2-2) Intra-Day Auction Session: 12:00 am - 12:02 am  \n            (2-3) Closing Auction Session: 16:30 am - 16:35 am  \n            (2-4) Rest of the time is regular trading hour or continous trading hour\n          \n    - 3) **The closing auction** trading period is a trading mechanism with a single price bidding. Buyers and sellers enter buy and sell orders during this period. This period is also known as **call period**. After collecting the relevant orders, the trading system will determine the order that can complete the most transactions based on the interaction of the orders. This event is known as **uncrossing event**.\n\n    - 4) **Why do we care about the closing auction book?** In the last ten minutes of the Nasdaq exchange trading session, market makers like Optiver merge traditional **order book data** with **auction book data(Closing Auction Order Book Data)**. This ability to consolidate information from both sources is critical for providing the best prices to all market participants.\n    \n    - 5) Bid & ask price of the closing auction book dataset in the call period are now **overlapping**.\n    \n    - 6) A typical closing auction book data **before** uncrossing event might look like this:\n\n\n| Bid Size (Buyer)| Price | Ask Size (Seller) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 10 | 1 |\n| 3 | 9 | 2 |\n| 4 | 8 | 4 |","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- **Example of closig auction mechanism:** \n\n    For the closing auction book example above, we can work through definitions for a few key terms. Suppose the auction uncrossed with the book in this state, then:\n\n    - 1) At a price of 10, 0 lots would be matched since there as no bids >= 10.\n\n    - 2) At a price of 9, 3 lots would be matched, as there are 3 bids >=9 and 6 asks <= 9.\n\n    - 3) At a price of 8, 4 lots would be matched, since are 7 bids>=8, and there are 4 asks<=8.\n\n        - The price which maximises the number of matched lots would be 8, therefore 8 is our uncross price.  \n    \n    \n- **Key Words Terminology with closing auction order book data**\n\n    - 1) **Uncross Price**: The price which maximises the number of matched lots. In the above example will be 8.\n\n    - 2) **Matched Size**: the max number of matched lots by one single price. In the above example will be 4.\n\n    - 3) **Imbalance**: Imbalance refers to the number of unmatched shares. In the above example, the uncross price is 8 and there are 7 bids & 4 asks which can be matched for the price of 8. As a result, we have three unmatched bids remaining, and the **remaining bids** contribute to an imbalance of three lots in the **buy direction**.\n\n- **More Key Words Terminology for Price Explanation:**\n\n    - 1) **Far Price**: The crossing price that will maximize the number of shares matched based on auction interest only. Therfore, Far price refers to the hypothetical uncross price of the auction book, if it were to uncross at the reporting time.\n\n    - 2) **Near Price**: The crossing price that will maximize the number of shares matched **based auction** and **continuous market orders**. Nasdaq provides near price information 5 minutes before the closing cross. Therefore, in the below figure we can see that starting from 300 sec, the near price/far price start to show.\n\n    - 3) **Reference Price**: \n\n        - If the \"Near Price\" is between the best bid and ask, then the reference price is equal to the near price\n\n        - If the \"Near Price\" > best ask, then reference price = best ask\n\n        - If the \"Near Price\" < best bid, then reference price = best bid So the reference price is the near price bounded between the best bid and ask. **In summary for reference price, it's a uncross price that best represent the price that will
